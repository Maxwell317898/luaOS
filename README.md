# Usage
to use all you need to do is navigate to the file after you download it and unzip
most OSes have an option to open terminal at a files location when you right click it, MacOS supports this and Windows allows you to copy the path of a selected file so you can pair that with ``cd path/da/s/das/`` Linux idk ¯_(ツ)_/¯
